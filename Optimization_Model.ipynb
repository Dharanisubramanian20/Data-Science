    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "### In a machine learning project, selecting the right subset of features is crucial for improving model accuracy and reducing computation time. We want to maximize model accuracy while minimizing the number of selected features using Linear Programming (LP).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Scenario:\n",
    "### A company is developing a predictive model to classify customer churn. There are 10 available features, but using all of them may lead to overfitting and unnecessary computational costs. We want to select the best features while ensuring the model accuracy remains high.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization Goal:\n",
    "### Maximize accuracy while selecting a limited number of features (at most 5 features).\n",
    "### Each feature contributes a different weight to accuracy.\n",
    "### The total cost of selected features should not exceed a predefined budget."
